  Charm to operate the Kubernetes Dashboard
summary: |
  Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized
  applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the
  cluster resources. You can use Dashboard to get an overview of applications running on your
  cluster, as well as for creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as
  Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc). For example, you can scale a Deployment, initiate a rolling
  update, restart a pod or deploy new applications using a deploy wizard.

  Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on
  any errors that may have occurred.
